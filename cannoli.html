        <!-- How to prepare -->
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make shells: Mix flour, sugar, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. <br>
                Cut in shortening until crumbly. Make a well in the center and add Marsala wine, <br> 
                water, vinegar, egg, and egg yolk. Mix with a fork until the dough becomes stiff, <br>
                then finish kneading it by hand on a clean surface, adding a bit more water if needed <br>
                for about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Divide cannoli dough into three balls; flatten each one just enough to get through the pasta machine. <br> 
                Roll a ball of dough through successively thinner settings until you have reached the thinnest setting. <br>
                Dust lightly with flour if necessary. Place the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. <br>
                Using a cutter or large glass, cut out 4 to 5-inch circles. Dust the circles with a light coating of flour. <br>
                This will help you later in removing the shells from the tubes. Roll dough around cannoli tubes, <br>
                sealing the edge with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough balls. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Fry shells on the tubes in hot oil, a few at a time, until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. <br>
                Use tongs to turn as needed. Remove shells carefully using tongs, and place them on a cooling rack <br> 
                set over paper towels. Cool just long enough that you can handle the tubes, then carefully twist the tube <br> 
                to remove the shell. Using a tea towel may help you get a better grip. Wash or wipe off the tubes, <br>
                and use them for more shells. Cooled shells can be placed in an airtight container and kept for up to 2 months. <br> 
                You should only fill them immediately or up to 1 hour before serving. <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Make filling: Mix ricotta cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl until well combined. <br>
                Fold in chocolate and lemon zest. Transfer mixture into a pastry bag and pipe into shells, <br>
                filling from the center to one end, then doing the same from the other side. Dust with additional <br> 
                confectioners' sugar to serve, if you like. <br>
            </li>
        </ol>
