        <!-- How to prepare -->
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>
                Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface.<br> 
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly <br>
                with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li><br>
            <li>
                Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. <br>
                Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. <br> 
                Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. <br>
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. <br>
                Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, <br>
                15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
