        <!-- How to prepare -->
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.<br> 
                Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, <br>
                parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; <br>
                mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Form mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
